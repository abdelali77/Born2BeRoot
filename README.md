# What is virtualization

#### Virtualization is the process of simulating hardware and software , such as a computers or operating systems. It's running a multiple virtual computers in one physical computer.

## Hypervisor

Hypervisor is the software that create and runs the vitualization , it's allowed one machine to run multiple machines in a virtual way , it's allocate and sharing the resources such as storage space and RAM and cpu between the actual physical machine and the virtual machine

## types of Hypervisors
* *type 1 (`bare-metal`)* : installed on bare matal hardware means that there is no existing operating system or any other software .
* *type 2* : is installed and runs on top of an existing operating system , so the operating system sits between the hardware resources and the hypervisor
